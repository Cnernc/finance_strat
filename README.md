# GitHub Portfolio: Python Coding Skills and Financial Strategies

Welcome to my GitHub repository, designed as a dynamic portfolio to showcase my Python programming skills and expertise in financial strategies.

Explore my GitHub portfolio showcasing Python skills and evolving financial strategies. From basic to complex trading techniques, innovative ideas, to a near-professional strategy ready for hedge fund deployment. A journey of growth and expertise in Python and finance.

Here's what you'll find:

- Introduction to Basic Strategies: I start by presenting fundamental financial strategies. It's a great way to see how simple concepts can be effectively implemented with Python.
- Refinement and Complexification: Gradually, these basic strategies are refined and made more complex. This process illustrates my step-by-step approach in enhancing trading techniques.
- Innovative Strategies: I then move on to more advanced, innovative, and original strategies. These projects demonstrate my ability to think outside the box and apply unique concepts to the financial domain.
- Presentation of a Developed Strategy: Finally, I present a high-level, nearly professional strategy, designed to be potentially deployed in a hedge fund (HF) environment. This showcases my level of expertise and ability to develop real-world ready solutions.
This repository reflects my journey and skills in Python, applied to financial strategies. It is continually updated with new ideas and approaches.
